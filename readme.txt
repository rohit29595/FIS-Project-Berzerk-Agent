Libraries used for visualization and statistical analysis:

Matplotlib

Scipy.stats


Steps to evaluate statistical analysis:



1. Uncomment the code to save the scores in the main function of each agent.py file.

2. Run each agent.py file for specific number of times.

3. Run the boxplot.py file to view the boxplot of the sample scores obtained. A boxplot.png file is also saved in the same file directory.

4. Run the anova.py file to view the ANOVA results (F-score and p-value) and also view the Histogram for the sample scores. A histogram.png file is also saved in the same file directory.
